# What is the vision?

I want it to be very similar to what we have right now, except better. I'm talking

- Tab completions for file paths, usernames, and commands
- Coloured output
- list and reqs output in tables. (Or even better, as a sidebar that keeps updating?
But for that, we would need to alt screen and have a warp-esque set up with typing on
the bottom and results going up)
- Progress bar
